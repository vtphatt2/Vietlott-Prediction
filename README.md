# Vietlott-Prediction
This repository explores deep learning techniques to predict Vietlott Mega 6/45 lottery numbers. **However, this project is purely for fun and educational purposes**. Since lottery draws are completely random, **it is impossible to make accurate predictions**. The primary goal of this project is to practice deep learning, Python, and PyTorch while experimenting with time-series forecasting.
